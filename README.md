# I DID NOT CREATE THE FRAMEWORK IMPLEMENTING ALPHA-ZERO, I ONLY IMPLEMENTED SHIFTAGO!

# ALPHASHIFTAGO ZERO

The framework for this was copied from https://github.com/suragnair/alpha-zero-general. I implemented the game of Shiftago in 2 versions, modified the code a little to match the game and created a few new models.

My success was moderate and the AI plays far weaker than a human player. But the AI beat a random player in both gamemodes. Minimax still beats this.
